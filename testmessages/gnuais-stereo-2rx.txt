gnuais-stereo-2rx.raw contains some AIS data from Helsinki, and
it can be used to measure the performance of the DSP decoding code.
When making changes to the DSP code, please try to decode this file
and make sure that the amount of properly decoded packets goes up,
not down. To decode the file, use the following configuration:

SoundInFile testmessages/gnuais-stereo-2rx.txt
SoundChannels both

Since svn revision 55 (2008-12-15) gnuais has been stable when
compiled with optimisation. The amount of decoded packets must be
the same when compiled with -O0 and -O3. If differences are found,
or if the program crashes with optimisation, there's probably a nasty
bug in the code.

The gnuais-stereo-2rx.raw file has been recorded using two receivers,
both connected to the same antenna and tuned to the same AIS channel.
Both channels contain the same packets, but channel B has a significantly
lower signal level, due to uneven power distribution in the antenna
cable splitting. So, on channel B there will be less packets decoded.

Please make a note here after the decoded packet counts change
in a certain revision.
