0.3.3:
    Able to print receiver statistics (range)
    Cleaned up some code
    Better console output messages
0.3.2:
    Building with osm-gps-map > 1.0 and GTK 3
0.3.1:
    Updated copyright information for files
    Workaround for tiles not working in gnuaisgui
0.3.0:
    GUI is working (using OpenStreetMap). Various other fixes
0.2.7:
    Added pulseaudio support
0.2.6:
    Fixed some compile issues
0.2.5:
    Looks for configuration file also in /etc/gnuais.conf, and
    installs a configuration file there automatically at 
        "make install"
    Using cmake instead of autotools
    New filter taps
    Prepared for deb-package generation
    Other small fixes 
0.2.2:
        Changed code a bit. Class B transponders do not have any
	"destination"-field.
	Code now adds fake destination field when it receives
	class B transponders message (type 19, 24).
        Fake field sets destination: "CLASS B TX".
	Just for "nice to know it came from class B vessel"- purposes.
	(Saku)
0.2.1:
	Added support of class B frames (types 18, 19, 24)
	Type 19 may have bug(s). Very little class B transponders around
	and type 19 frame is seen only if another station polls class B
	transponder
	(actualLy never here) so debugging is not easy on any class B
	frames. (Sakari Nylund)


0.2.0:
	Fixed 6-bit ASCII decoding to also handle numbers and special
	characters. (Hessu)
	
	Latitude and longitude were mixed in the ais_basestation MySQL
	table, fixed. (Ruben)
	
	The separate gnuaissavetofile program was removed. (Ruben)
	
	Fixed MySQL handling in the configure script. (David Herring)
	
0.1.1:
	Fixed a little bug in ALSA sound device handling: use exactly
	whatever buffer size is suggested by ALSA, so that some sound
	devices won't fail with an overrun after running for a while.
	(Tomi, Hessu)

0.1.0:
	Improved AIS decoding DSP code.
	
	Added JSON AIS HTTP POST data exporting.
	
	Implemented decoding from a stereo sound card, either left, right, or
	both channels at the same time. Supports two receivers on the two
	AIS channels.
	
	Implemented sound peak level logging at configurable interval, or
	every 30 seconds when the level is higher than 98%.
	
	Added configurable logging to stderr/syslog/log file.
	
	Added a nice configuration file and command line parser.
	
	Implemented forking to background (-f).
	
	Removed separate gnuaisfromfile.c file, since it was almost
	completely duplicate with ais.c - the "read from file" functionality
	is now done using the -l option to gnuais. Reduces maintenance work.
	
	Fixed buffer overflow (security) bugs in the SQL query generation.
	The SQL code crashed on SEGV when run with file input (lots of
	data coming in and overwriting the query buffers).
	
	Implemented automatic reconnection to MySQL if the connection goes
	away (server crash, network outage, inactivity timeout).
	
	Fixed memory corruption bugs, now works when compiled with -O3.
	
0.0.7:
	gnuais can decode positions south of equator + minor other fixes

0.0.6:
	Added GUI which is in development. A lot of work to do yet.. There
	have also been made some minor fixes. For example the configure script
	now checks for alsa and gtk.

0.0.5:
	Some fixes

0.0.4:
	Added NMEA-sentences for outputting to third-party map software (Thanks to Sakari Nylund). 
	There have also been made some bug-fixes, and different details here and
	there, have been changed.

0.0.3:
	Translated all code from C++ to C. Using Alsa instead of OSS. Using
	only one thread now. It seemed to be unnecessary to have one
	extra thread for sound input.

0.0.2:
	MySQL-functionality and config file (/etc/gnuais.conf)
