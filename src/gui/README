This is a graphical user environment in development. Far from finished yet.

You can pipe NMEA sentences to a named pipe in /tmp/gnuaispipe.

If you want your own map, you will need to make an image file called map.png, and a calibrate file called map.cbr.  The calibrate file contains:

top-left-longitude
top-left-latitude
bottom-right-longitude
bottom-right-latitude


See examples (map.cbr) in this folder if you are unsure.
