If you want to save to a mysql database you will have to make a file called gnuais.conf
in your /etc-folder.
An example can be found in this folder (gnuais.conf-example).
You will also have to create a table in the database:


Make new database (if needed) with command:
  mysqladmin create <databasename>

You can also use any existing database adding table 'ais':
  mysql <databasename>  < create_table.sql
  
Or if you have specified username and password for your database:
  mysql -u <username> -p <databasename>  < create_table.sql
  
 

The file create_table.sql can be found in this folder.
