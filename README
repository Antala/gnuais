The configuration can be found in the file gnuais.conf. GNU AIS looks for this file
first in the working directory, then /etc/gnuais.conf and then /usr/local/etc/gnuais.conf.
An alternative configuration file can be specified with the command line argument -c <filename>.
It is explained in gnuais.conf how you will have to edit it in order to fullfill your wishes.

You will also have to create a table in the database if the mysql option is desired:


Make new database (if needed) with command:
  mysqladmin create <databasename>

You can also use any existing database adding table 'ais':
  mysql <databasename>  < create_table.sql
  
Or if you have specified username and password for your database:
  mysql -u <username> -p <databasename>  < create_table.sql
  
 

The file create_table.sql can be found in this folder.
