You will have to make a gnuais.conf configuration file and store it in the folder you
run gnuais from - or specify its location with the -c option. Simply copy and edit
the file: ''gnuais.conf-example''. It is explained in that file how you will have to
edit it in order to fullfill your wishes.

You will also have to create a table in the database if the mysql option is desired:


Make new database (if needed) with command:
  mysqladmin create <databasename>

You can also use any existing database adding table 'ais':
  mysql <databasename>  < create_table.sql
  
Or if you have specified username and password for your database:
  mysql -u <username> -p <databasename>  < create_table.sql
  
 

The file create_table.sql can be found in this folder.
